			<h2>Who we are</h2>
				<div>
					<p>Two guys own this company &mdash; Blixa Morgan and Brendan Hill. Project Make It is relatively new, but we have a lot of experience and skills to bring.</p>
					<h3>Brendan Hill</h3>
					<blockquote>I do business and design. I earned my Business Administration degree from the Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas, was a Product Manager at the international-level of a multinational business software company, and am currently under a non-disclosure agreement from a search giant (don't get excited; I just did marketing. After a tour contracting in Afghanistan (again, don't get excited; I just did IT), family led to me being in Tulsa! One of the great things about my life being such an adventure in recent years is that I can offer a broad base of understanding about problems and also how to work with different people that I don't think many others could put in context.</blockquote>
					<h3>Blixa Morgan</h3>
					<blockquote>Blixa is the programmer, and a quick study of most everything else. Writing, though, is not one of those things; so his &quot;about&quot; section is in the third-person. Blixa started coding applications (in javascript) 12 years ago, because it was fun! Like certain other techie people, Blixa tried college but didn't like it; he learned faster exploring the bleeding edge driven by his own curiousity. Before co-founding Project Make It, he created the mobile app for Tokyo in Tulsa and made webpages for a few clients.</blockquote>
