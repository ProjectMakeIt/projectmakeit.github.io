						<blockquote>I do business and design. I earned my Business Administration degree from the Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas, was a Product Manager at the international-level of a multinational business software company, and am currently under a non-disclosure agreement from a search giant (don't get excited; I just did marketing. After a tour contracting in Afghanistan (again, don't get excited; I just did IT), family led to me being in Tulsa! One of the great things about my life being such an adventure in recent years is that I can offer a broad base of understanding about problems and also how to work with different people that I don't think many others could put in context.</blockquote>

						<blockquote>Blixa is the programmer, and a quick study of most everything else. Writing, though, is not one of those things; so his &quot;about&quot; section is in the third-person. Blixa started coding applications (in javascript) 12 years ago, because it was fun! Like certain other techie people, Blixa tried college but didn't like it; he learned faster exploring the bleeding edge driven by his own curiousity. Before co-founding Project Make It, he created the mobile app for Tokyo in Tulsa and made webpages for a few clients.</blockquote>

					<h2>Our Principles</h2>
					<blockquote>
						Our tagline <span>&quot;Modern. Simple. Done.&quot;</span> hits the high notes of what we deliver. But let's spell it out some more.
					</blockquote>
					<ul>
						<li><h3>Modern</h3> &mdash; We make web apps, mostly. Applications used to live on one machine as a copy of what the makers had already done some time ago, and keeping up-to-date with the makers' work was a chore. Web apps are always the latest version, and over 90% of the time people's work requires being online. So we don't do legacy software or design for users who don't use up-to-date web browsers.</li>
						<li><h3>Simple</h3> &mdash; The ideal solution is the least solution necessary to achieve what it was designed to achieve.</li>
						<li><h3>Done</h3> &mdash; Working on the same problems endlessly is boring for us and frustrating for you as a client. We structure milestones to deliver a working, but simlified, version of the end goal. Building fragments of the full-blown system envisioned delivers nothing you can actually use until far down the line. We think our way is better for you and for feedback to our development process.</li>
